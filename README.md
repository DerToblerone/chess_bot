my attempt at creating a chess engine in cpp

this is a very basic attempt at a program that plays chess.
it has no en passant. also it can castle into and out of check.
the main focus of this was to grasp the basic principle and provide
a proof of concept. in the process of making this i studied the code 
of the micro max chess engine by H.G Mueller. especially the mvoe generation
is very similar.
